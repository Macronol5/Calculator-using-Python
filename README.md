# Calculator-using-PythonWe are presenting you one of the shortest and simplest calculator program in python you could ever found.

We will be creating a calculator that will add, subtract, divide, and multiply two numbers.

We will run the program until we don’t want to exit using a while loop, so that we can calculate as many as calculations we want.

First, we will ask the user to choose one of the four basic operations i.e. “Addition“, “Subtraction“, “Multiplication“, and “Division“.

print("1. Addition")
print("2. Subtraction")
print("3. Multiplication")
print("4. Division")


We will also give choice to the user so that he can exit the program whenever he wants.


print("5. Exit")


Now, we will store the value entered by the user using the variable “choice“.


choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))

OUTPUT:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter two numbers: 
12
23
Result =  35
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 2
Enter two numbers:

12
Result =  11
